# CSE499-Senior-Design-Project

# ABSTRACT 
We’ve carried out a proposal to design a chatbot specifically for the people of Bangladesh that answers questions related to different health aspects ranging from children, adolescence, women’s health issues as well as questions that are considered taboo in our social system. We want to demonstrate how our chatbot can help solve small health issues that are
solvable via a few information, social hysteria and taboo related superstitions and provide necessary emergency facility if needed in desperate situations like suicide.

# MOTIVATION 
A chatbot is a software that is used to provide interaction between a computer and a human being. For the past couple of years, we’ve seen an increase of chatbot related to Bangla language and mostly for the people of Bangladesh. These chatbot ranged from offline tools, support for different websites, for example: “Sheba” by Robi Axiata Limited, “Doly Bangla Chatbot for Bengali Education'' published on IEEE, “Alice chatbot as domain specific knowledge bot for BRAC U (FAQ bot)” by BRAC University. Our chatbot is available on both Bengali language as well as English. This is why literate as well as semi-literate rural area’s people will be able to benefit from this app. We want our chatbot to behave and respond like a human being, or anything similar to the experience of speaking directly to a human being.


# BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE
In Bangladesh we don’t have many chatbot regarding health related issues. We have other chatbot for e-commerce site, telecom companies but not for our health issues. Our project will focus on mental health/depression, women's health, and taboo related.

As many of us suffer from these kinds of problems, there is actually no one to talk about it. Many people don't like to hear other people’s problems as their own life is full of problems already. So our aim is to create something so people can open themselves instead of keeping it in mind. 

To implement this project, we would like to apply NLP (Natural Language Processing). We can use term frequency and document frequency to understand how often a word is used or how important a word is to a document. Like if any user just repeating words related to suicide/depression, then chatbot will detect that & turn the conversation in a way that the user can express his mind in a more specific way and get immediate help. We used Normalization processes to check spelling of different user inputs. Recognizing Entities can help us to find out which topic. It can be a year such as 2021, a person’s name such as Tahmid, Noshin, Anjum, Ahnaf, Aurik etc.

Our aim is to make this chatbot as interactive as possible. That’s why we gave both options of either voice input question answering system or type input system. 

# DISCUSSED SECTIONS FOR PURPOSES AND UPDATED PROPOSALS
*Smartphone dependency among youth are portrayed on our chatbot.
*Depression relating to youth is a concern for the Bangladeshi society system.
Literacy rate of rural people
*How familiar rural people on digital platform
*Different designs for rural and urban also so that it’s easy specially for semi-literate people
*Make it comfortable to view for elderly people
*Design a speaker icon which can be used to show results without signing in or typing anything
*Keep design UI aspect for both semi-literate, literate and also not literate persons.
*Keep response time for searching the database and showing the result to the user as low as possible. For that we’ve proposed to optimize on our coding part. 
*Health workers and volunteers will have a dedicated option after signing in with their email address.
*Application will overall be user friendly.

# SOCIAL FEEDBACK
We hope to gain positive feedback from the community by providing our service. We expect the chatbot to be regarded as something positive, rather than a negative aspect of online health information. The chatbot should be able to resolve some of the superstitions regarding women’s health and taboo related areas. Especially on the rural side there are many misconceptions about health issues. We believe as a citizen we have a social responsibility to provide education that others haven’t got. This is one of the reasons for our team to develop the chatbot.

# PROGRESS
Our team is aware that during the development phase, things can go wrong. Machine learning is challenging to us and we’ve taken the challenge. This is why we’ve taken the initiative to understand every fundamental implementation before we start coding and preparing the chatbot for user testing. Our view is that we hope to see positive feedback from our chatbot from not only the users who will be testing initially, but also from different areas of the country. With sufficient support, we’re confident that we can pull off our project successfully.
