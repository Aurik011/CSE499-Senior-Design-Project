ABSTRACT 
We’ve carried out a proposal to design a chatbot specifically for the
people of Bangladesh that answers questions related to different health
aspects ranging from children, adolescence, women’s health issues as well
as questions that are considered taboo in our social system. We want to
demonstrate how our chatbot can help solve small health issues that are
solvable via a few information, social hysteria and taboo related super-
stitions and provide necessary emergency facility if needed in desperate
situations like suicide.
